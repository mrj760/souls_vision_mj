# Souls Vision
Souls Vision adds a customizable overlay to the top-right corner of the screen (by default), showing additional information about the currently targeted enemy, including HP, Stamina, Stance, Buildup bars for effects (like Poison and Frostbite) and the best damage types to use against the enemy (Magic, Fire, etc.). The overlay is draggable and can be customized to show only the information you want.

## Features
* **Stat Bars**: Shows the current and maximum HP, FP, Stamina, and Stagger/Poise of the targeted enemy.
  * The FP bar usually only appear to "player-like" enemies
* **Best Effects**: Shows the best effects to use against the targeted enemy, based on the lowest value necessary to trigger them.
* **Immune Effects**: Shows the effects that the targeted enemy is immune to in gray at the right of the best effects.
* **Damage Types**: Shows the damage types that the targeted enemy is weak to, resistant to, or neutral to with icons highlighting how good or bad they are.
  * The neutral damage types are hidden by default, but can be shown by changing the config file.
* **Buildup Bars**: Shows the current buildup of effects like Poison, Scarlet Rot, Hemorrhage, Death Blight, Frostbite, Sleep, and Madness.
  * Only appear if the enemy has some effect being applied to it.
* **Customizable**: Highly customizable, with options to change the positions, sizes, and visibility of the components.
  * The config file is generated the first time the game is opened with the mod, and it is reloaded automatically every time it is edited.
* **Draggable Overlay**: The overlay can be dragged around the screen by clicking and dragging it.
  * The parameter `dragOverlay` must be set to `true` in the config file to enable this feature.
  * I recommend enabling entering a menu (like Equipment) to show mouse cursor to make it easier to drag the overlay. (I'm working on a better way to do this)

## Configuration
<details>
<summary>Config file details</summary>
The first time the game opens with the mod it will generate a default sv_config.json placing the bars at the top-right of the screen. Every time the config file is edited, it will be reloaded automatically.

## Compatibility
Souls Vision was developed and tested on version **1.16**, it is expected to work with previous and future versions as long as the game’s internal structures remain unchanged since it relies on memory reading. Some incompatibilities with mods that deal with game's FPS are expected as Souls Vision is tied to the game's rendering methods. Either way, let me know if any kind of error occurs.

Add the `souls_vision.dll` to the `mods` folder from [Elden Mod Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/117)
